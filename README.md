# Jinbot
Discord bot written in python using discord.py v2. Has a lot of stuff- a levelling system, currency system, tag system that uses a cloud db. There are also commands to look up movies from Letterboxd, PSN profiles from psnprofiles and games from metacritic using web scraping. Has some moderating tools too- timeouts, bans and unbans. 

I don't recommend trying to get this code run since its mostly custom-made, but its great for getting ideas
